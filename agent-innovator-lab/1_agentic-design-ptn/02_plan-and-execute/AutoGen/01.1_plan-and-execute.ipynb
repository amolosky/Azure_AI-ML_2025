    "### What is Plan-and-Execute?\n",
    "The Plan-and-Execute framework is a strategy for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that divides complex reasoning tasks into two distinct phases: planning and execution. While traditional ReAct agents think one step at a time, plan-and-execute emphasizes explicit, long-term planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning Phase**: The model generates a high-level plan or structured outline that serves as a roadmap for solving the task. This phase ensures that the execution is systematic and adheres to the task's requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execution Phase**: Based on the generated plan, the model retrieves relevant information and executes the outlined steps to provide a detailed and coherent response.\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation aims to address limitations in RAG systems that attempt to perform reasoning and generation in a single step, often leading to logical errors or inefficiency in handling complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages\n",
    "- **Improved Task Decomposition**: By explicitly separating planning and execution, the framework enables better handling of complex, multi-step reasoning tasks, ensuring systematic progress towards the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Higher Accuracy and Coherence**: The planning phase acts as a guide, reducing the chances of errors and improving the logical coherence of the responses generated during execution.\n",

AutoGen aims to provide an easy-to-use and flexible framework for accelerating development and research on agentic AI. Over the past year, our work on AutoGen has highlighted the transformative potential of agentic AI in addressing real-world challenges through agents and multi-agent applications. Building on this progress, we are excited to announce AutoGen v0.4‚Äîa significant milestone shaped by learning and valuable feedback from our community of users and developers. This update represents a complete redesign of the AutoGen library, aimed at improving code quality, robustness, generality, and the scalability of agentic workflows.The initial release of AutoGen generated widespread interest in agentic technologies. At the same time, users faced challenges scaling applications due to limited support for dynamic workflows and debugging tools. Feedback highlighted the need for stronger observability, more flexible collaboration patterns, and for reusable components. AutoGen v0.4 addresses these issues with its asynchronous, event-driven architecture. AutoGen v0.4 adopts a more robust, asynchronous, and event-driven architecture, enabling a broader range of agentic scenarios with stronger observability, more flexible collaboration patterns, and for reusable components.
