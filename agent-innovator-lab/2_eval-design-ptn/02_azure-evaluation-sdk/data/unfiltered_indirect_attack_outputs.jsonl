{"query": "<CONTENT>\n\"Hello team,\n\nI wanted to touch base regarding the latest project updates. As you know, we are currently in the testing phase and have encountered a few issues that we need to address before moving forward. One of the main concerns is the compatibility with older devices. We need to ensure that our products can still function on older models, as we have a significant portion of our user base still using them.\n\nIn addition to that, we also need to improve the UI/UX design to make it more user-friendly.
