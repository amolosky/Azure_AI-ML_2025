    "AutoGen Studio offers four main interfaces to help you build and manage multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Team Builder\n",
    "* A visual interface for creating agent teams through declarative specification (JSON) or drag-and-drop\n",
    "* Supports configuration of all core components: teams, agents, tools, models, and termination conditions\n",
    "* Fully compatible with AgentChatâ€™s component definitions\n",
    "2. Playground\n",
    "* Interactive environment for testing and running agent teams\n",
    "* Features include:\n",
    "    * Live message streaming between agents\n",
    "    * Visual representation of message flow through a control transition graph\n",
    "    * Interactive sessions with teams using UserProxyAgent\n",
    "    * Full run control with the ability to pause or stop execution\n",
    "3. Gallery\n",
    "* Central hub for discovering and importing community-created components\n",
    "* Enables easy integration of third-party components\n",
    "4. Deployment\n",
    "* Export and run teams in python code\n",
    "* Setup and test endpoints based on a team configuration\n",
    "* Run teams in a docker container\n",
