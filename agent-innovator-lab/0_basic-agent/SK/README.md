## Core Features of Semantic Kernel

**AI Service Integration:** SK offers abstractions for various AI services, including chat, text-to-image, and audio-to-text functionalities. It supports integration with platforms like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face, allowing developers to leverage state-of-the-art AI models in their applications. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

**Extensible Plugin Architecture:** Developers can define plugins that combine natural language semantic functions with traditional code. This modular approach enables the creation of complex functionalities through simple configurations, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of applications. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

**Memory and Context Management:** SK incorporates embeddings-based memory, allowing applications to retain context and provide more coherent and relevant responses over time. This feature is crucial for developing applications that require understanding of user interactions and historical data. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

**Planning and Orchestration:** With built-in planners, SK can automatically orchestrate plugins to achieve specific user goals. This capability enables dynamic and intelligent decision-making within applications, enhancing user experiences by providing tailored solutions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

**Observability and Security:** Designed with enterprise needs in mind, SK includes features like telemetry support, hooks, and filters to ensure responsible AI usage. These features provide insights into application performance and help maintain compliance with security standards. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

**Future-Proof Design:** SK is built to adapt to advancements in AI technology. Its flexible architecture allows developers to integrate new models and technologies without extensive codebase modifications, ensuring that applications remain up-to-date with minimal effort. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
